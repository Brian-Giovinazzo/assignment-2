# Assignment 2

This assignment serves as a quick introductory practice to C programming, setting the stage for more complex assignments later. 
You are to perform the following programming tasks:

### Programming Task 1: 5 points

Implement **time_conversion.c** with the following specifications:

- The program will accept one command line argument represents the number of minutes. 
- The program will convert this value into hours. 
- The program will print out the result to console using the following format: **X hours Y minutes**. 
- For example, an input of 245 will give you **4 hours 5 minutes**. 


### Programming Task 2: 10 points

Implement **product.c** with the following specifications: 

- The program will accept a single command line argument representing the path to a text file containing the values of these integers. 
  - There will be one integer per line.
  - The values of the integers will be between 1 and 20. 
  - There will be ten lines. 
- The program will read these ten integers from the text file in part a into an array of integers. 
- The program will print out the sum of these intergers on one line. 
- The program will print out the product of these integers on the next line. 


## Submission

- Edit the README.md to add your name to the top of the file
- Submit the URL of your assignment git repository, as provided through GitHub Classroom to D2L. 
- Besides the two required files, **product.c** and **time_conversion.c** and any other related header/supporting files, you must not make any changes to the existing test files or test script. 
- The last commit to your git repository must be made prior to the deadline of the assignment. Any subsequent commit will not be considered.
